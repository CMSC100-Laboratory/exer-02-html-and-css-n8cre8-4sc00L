Steps to Create Github Page:
1. Clone new repository to local machine
2. Configure git and commit website file
3. Set repository to public and configure github pages in settings (pages, under code and automation)
4. Wait a few moments; the new github page should show up in settings.

Key takeaways:
A. CSS is way more difficult for me than HTML (and probably even javascript), not really the design part but the implementation part, where you have to get the right size, and right spacing.
B. There's a slight feeling of euphoria after I finished commiting the final webpage.
C. In time-constrained environments, it's better to settle for a less creative webpage, as long as it is stable.
